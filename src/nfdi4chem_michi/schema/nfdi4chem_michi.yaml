  # Information
  Dataset:
    mixins:
      - NamedThing

  # Directive Information
  Protocol:
    class_uri: OBI:0000272
    description: The information that specifies how to execute a planned process, in terms of what steps and actions must be taken and what preconditions must be met

  # Attributes
  Characteristic:
    description: An attribute/characteristic of an entity (which could be a material entity, information or process)
    slots:
      - has_quantitative_value # range: data item with value specification of unit and precision
      - output_of_analysis # range: analysis that determined this characteristic

  # Material entities
  MaterialEntity:
    class_uri: BFO:0000040
    mixins:
      - NamedThing
    description: "Material entities are three-dimensional entities (entities extended in three spatial dimensions), 
    as contrasted with the processes in which they participate, which are four-dimensional entities (entities extended 
    also along the dimension of time)"

  Sample:
    is_a: MaterialEntity
    description: The material entity that is being evaluated to assay its attributes/characteristic.
    slots:
      - output_of_sampling_process # rang: sampling process - which is the process that determines where it came from
      - has_characteristic # range: characteristic - the quality being determined by an analysis/assay
    todos:
      - "Review with regard to the ISA model and the controlled/independent & dependent variable part"

  # chemical entities
  ChemicalEntity:
    is_a: MaterialEntity
    class_uri: CHEBI:23367
    description: "Any constitutionally or isotopically distinct atom, molecule, ion, ion pair, radical, radical ion, 
    complex, conformer etc., identifiable as a separately distinguishable entity."
    comments:
      - "This is actually mapped to CHEBI:molecular entity (CHEBI:23367), from which we just copied the definition 
      into our description. We did so to be able to reuse the label Chemical Entity. We do not use (ignore) the 
      chemical entity class from CHEBI as this is only a grouping class, and chemical entity is rather that which constitutes a chemical substance"
      - "There was the issue with theoretical chemist postulating chemical entities that are not physical existing -->
        write/ask in the OBO or BFO discuss list?"

  ChemicalSubstance:
    is_a: MaterialEntity
    class_uri: CHEBI:59999
    description: A MaterialEntity that is composed of multiple Chemical Entities of either the same or different kind

      - provenance # range: information about the chemical substance that determines where it came from
      - composed_of_chemical_entity # range: chemical entity - relation
      - space_group
      - iupac_name
    examples:

    comments:
      - "CHEBI definition: A chemical substance is a portion of matter of constant composition, composed of molecular
      entities of the same type or of different types."
      - "Examples: a polymer, a mixture of ethanol and methanol, O2 Ti"
    todos:
      - we need to describe ratios of chemical entities in a chemical substance

  # devices

      - has_function # range Function, the main function of the device -> what it can measure
      - has_setting # range: information that specifies an attribute of the Device
      - has_visual_representation # range: some image, schema drawing etc. which depicts the layout of the device
      - has_type # placeholder to remember that we need to be able to specify a specialization/kind of the device, e.g. NMR spectrometer
