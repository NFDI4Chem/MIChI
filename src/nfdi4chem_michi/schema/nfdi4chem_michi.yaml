      - "This is actually mapped to CHEBI:molecular entity (CHEBI:23367), from which we just copied the definition 
      into our description. We did so to be able to reuse the label Chemical Entity. We do not use (ignore) the 
      chemical entity class from CHEBI as this is only a grouping class, and chemical entity is rather that which constitutes a chemical substance"
